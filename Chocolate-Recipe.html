        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C°/350°F (160°C fan). Read Note 4 regarding shelf positions.</li>
            <li>Grease 2 x 22cm/9" cake pans with butter, then line the base. (Note 3 re: springform pans and other pan sizes).</li>

        </ol>
        

        <h3 class = "color-chocolate">Batter:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add Sugar and salt. Whisk briefly to combine.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free - about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add boiling water and whisk to incorporate. The batter is VERY thin (see video).</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. See Note 4 regarding cook time if pans are on different shelves.</li>
            <li>Cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks upside down (Note 5).</li>
            <li>Cool completely before frosting. I frosted the cake with my <a href = "https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-buttercream-frosting/" target = "_blank">Chocolate Buttercream Frosting</a> (scale recipe up by 50%).</li>
