                This is a classic butter cake but with Japanese techniques applied for 
                the most plush, soft and moist yellow cake like you've never had before.
                This professional bakery style cake stays fresh and moist for 4 days â€” that's
                unheard of! Use the same batter for perfect Vanilla Cupcakes.

                    This is a really easy yet exceptional Chocolate Cake that truly tastes of
                    chocolate. The crumb is beautifully tender and moist, and it keeps for up
                    to 5 days. It requires no beater, just a wooden spoon.
